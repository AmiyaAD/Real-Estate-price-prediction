# Real Estate Cost Price Prediction 🏡📈

This project focuses on predicting real estate property prices using machine learning regression models. Accurate price prediction is crucial for buyers, sellers, and real estate investors to make informed decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Build a regression model to estimate property prices.
- Use features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities.
- Apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: Public real estate datasets (e.g., Kaggle).
- Features may include:
  - **Location**: City, neighborhood, or postal code
  - **Size**: Square footage or area
  - **Rooms**: Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
  - **Amenities**: Parking, garden, pool, etc.
  - **Year Built**: Age of the property
  - **Price**: Target variable

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize distributions, correlations, and feature impacts.
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Encode categorical variables (location, amenities)  
   - Create derived features (price per square foot, age of property)  
   - Scale numerical features
4. **Modeling**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - SVR
   - Dicision Tree Regressor
5. **Evaluation**  
   Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² score

## 📊 Results
- Compare models based on accuracy and interpretability.
- Visualize predicted vs actual property prices.
